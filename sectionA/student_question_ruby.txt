Student Question

Hi there,
I’m having issues with the custom spellchecker I was asked to build. When I use
the input “cat ct”, I’m not getting “cat *ct*” as expected. Could you please point
me in the right direction?
Thanks,
Student

Task
For context, the task the student is working on is as follows:
● Create a custom spellchecker.
● The application should take as input a string of words separated by spaces.
● Any incorrectly spelt words should have an asterisk on either side.
○ For example, “cat ct” -> “cat *ct*”
● Eventually, it should be able to check the words of common types of pets,
namely cat, dog, rabbit, hamster, budgie and parrot, with the potential to
expand this in the future.
● You should not use a loop to solve the problem
